hello this is example program 
these cleasses are derived directly or indriectly from the classes istrem and ostream 
we have alrey used object whose types were these classes : 
cin istram and count 
Sets are containers that store unique elements following a specific order 
In a set the value of an element also identifies it ( the value is itself the key of type T ) and each value must be unique
Elements in associative containers are referenced by their key and not by their absolute position in the container
The elements in the container follow a strict order at all times
All inserted elements are given a position in this order
he value of an element is also the key used to identify it
